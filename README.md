Safe Presale

This smart contract is created to lock presale funds into a programmed owned escrow account that can only be used for deploying funds into a raydium AMM when criteria are met.

Features:
1. Customize presale duration/target, whitelisted collections, max purchase per wallet, creators fee, etc.
2. Soulbound each presale purchase to a NFT (so that vesting tokens can be traded via the NFT as proxy)
3. If presale conditions are not met, users can withdraw their funds.
